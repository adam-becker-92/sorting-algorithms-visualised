# Sorting Algorithms Visualised

Project to explore and understand sorting algorithms by visualising them using web-components

Project creates a bundle that can be used to insert sorting algorithim elements into the DOM.

So far I've created for elements for:

```javascript
<bubble-sort>
<insert-sort>
<merge-sort>
<quick-sort>
```

Example of usage can be found on this blog post where the bundle has been added to the page and elements have been added into the DOM.
